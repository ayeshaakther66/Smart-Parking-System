# Smart-Parking-System

A smart parking system with an automation gate that automatically opens when a car approaches it. Two parking spaces have an RGB light above them to indicate whether they are booked or not, and whether or not a car is parked there. There is also an analogue temperature sensor that monitors the temperature of the parking lot and opens the gate if it exceeds a specified threshold.
